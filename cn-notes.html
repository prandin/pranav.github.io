		<h2>Framing</h2>
		<p>For Ethernets, the frames are broadcasted to all receivers on the link. Only the intended recipient accepts the frame. However, there are some issues:
		<ol>
			<li>The SFD indicates when the frame begins, and the receivers check their own addresses with the one in the frame. Assuming that a frame has arrived at the intended receiver and it has begun reading, what happens if another frame arrives at the same receiver. </li>
			<ul>
				<li>Does it treat the second frame as a separate entity, or as a part of the current frame? </li>
				<li>We could ensure that all frames are of fixed size. Issue? Fragmentation </li>
			</ul>
			<li>Variable Size Framing could be implemented using a length field (used in Ethernets) or an end-frame delimiter (used in Token Ring) </li>
			<ul>
				<li>Character oriented methods</li> - What if the delimiter appears in the actual data?
				<li>Byte stuffing</li>
				<li>Bit stuffing: add a "complementary" bit for every first n-1 bit-sequence that match with an n-bit delimiter.</li>
		</ol>
		<p>Example 1 : If the frame delimiter flag used by a transmitter is "0111", how is the data sequence "01110110" transmitted using bit-stuffing?
			<br>"0111" means match with "011" in data and add complementary bit "0" to separate the data from the flag. Transmitted data = 011 0 1011 0 0
