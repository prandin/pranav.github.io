		<h2>Framing</h2>
		<p>For Ethernets, the frames are broadcasted to all receivers on the link. Only the intended recipient accepts the frame. However, there are some issues:
		<ol>
			<li>The SFD indicates when the frame begins, and the receivers check their own addresses with the one in the frame. Assuming that a frame has arrived at the intended receiver and it has begun reading, what happens if another frame arrives at the same receiver. </li>
			<ul>
				<li>Does it treat the second frame as a separate entity, or as a part of the current frame? </li>
			</ul>
		</ol>
