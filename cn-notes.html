		<h2>Framing</h2>
		<p>For Ethernets, the frames are broadcasted to all receivers on the link. Only the intended recipient accepts the frame. However, there are some issues:
		<ol>
			<li>The SFD indicates when the frame begins, and the receivers check their own addresses with the one in the frame. Assuming that a frame has arrived at the intended receiver and it has begun reading, what happens if another frame arrives at the same receiver. </li>
			<ul>
				<li>Does it treat the second frame as a separate entity, or as a part of the current frame? </li>
				<li>We could ensure that all frames are of fixed size. Issue? Fragmentation </li>
			</ul>
			<li>Variable Size Framing could be implemented using a length field (used in Ethernets) or an end-frame delimiter (used in Token Ring) </li>
			<ul>
				<li>Character oriented methods</li> - What if the delimiter appears in the actual data?
				<li>Byte stuffing</li>
				<li>Bit stuffing: add a "complementary" bit for every first n-1 bit-sequence that matches with an n-bit delimiter.</li>
		</ol>
		<p>Example 1 : If the frame delimiter flag used by a transmitter is "0111", how is the data sequence "01110110" transmitted using bit-stuffing?
			<br>"0111" means match with "011" in data and add complementary bit "0" to separate the data from the flag. Transmitted data = 011 0 1011 0 0
		</p>

		<h2>Switching</h2>
		<p>In the context of computer networks, switching is the process of forwarding a packet from one port to another. Routing, on the other hand is the process of preparing routing tables at each router. </p>
		<p>The two common methods of switching are (a) circuit switching, and (b) packet switching.
			Among them, circuit switching used to be prevalent in telephone communication (at exchange centers) at a time when the concept of computer networks and layering did not exist.
			Packet switching is performed at network layer, while circuit switching is not.
		</p>
		<p>
			The total time taken for a frame to reach from a sender to receiver =
			Setup Time + Transmission Time + (#hops)Propagation Delay + Tear-down time
		</p>
		<p>Properties of Circuit Switching:
			<ul>
				<li>Since the connection resources are reserved and fixed during communication, there is no need for a header</li>
				<li>The frames is guaranteed to arrive in the same order as they are sent i.e. there is no reordering</li>
			</ul>
		</p>

		<h3>Packet Switching</h3>
		<p>
			Packet switching uses store-and-forward technique during transmission since it is not guaranteed that the
			resources are reserved. When this happens, intermediate routers will "queue" the packet until it can be transmitted on the link.
			<br>
			Total time = (#hops)[Transmission delay + Propagation Delay] + (#hops - 1)[Queueing delay + Processing Delay]
			<br>
			<em>Question 1:</em> How is the total time for transmission for circuit switching different from packet switching?
			<br><br>
			<em>Question 2:</em> Which switching technique is preferred when the packet size is very large?
			<br><br>
			<em>Question 3: </em>How can the total time for transmission in packet switching be reduced? [Hint: Pipelining with smaller packets]
			<br><br>
			<em>Question 4:</em> Consider a file of size 1000 bytes. Compare the transmission delays T1, T2, and T3 respectively of the store-and-forward packet switching approaches given below. Assume the header length of a packet to be 100 bytes, and the bandwidth to be same for all cases.
			(a)The entire file transmitted as such takes T1 time
			(b)The file split into 10 uniform packets takes T2 time
			(c)The file split into 20 uniform packets takes T3 time
			<br><br>

			<h4> Pipelined Forwarding </h4>
			<p>
				We can save some time if the data to be sent is split into smaller packets and transmitted using pipeline. The,
				<br>
				Total time taken to transmit the entire data
				<br>
				= Time for the first packet to reach the destination +
				Time for remaining (n-1) packets to reach the destination
				<br>
				= (# hops)[Transmission_Delay + Propagation_Delay] + (# hops - 1)[Queueing Delay + Processing Delay] + (n-1)[Transmission_Delay]
				<br><br>
			<em>Question 5:</em> Considering question 4, now assume that transmission between sender and receiver has 2 routers. Calculate the total time taken for transmission for each of the three cases.
		</p>

		<p>
			<b>Note:</b>Observe that the improvement in transmission time is not linear with the decrease in packet size.

			<b> Homework: </b>
			<p> <b>[Question 1]: </b>Two hosts A and B are connected via two routers R1 and R2. Each link between the nodes are of 100 km each, with a transmission speed of 10^8 m/s and a bandwidth of 1 Mbps.
				A file of size 10^6 bits is split into packets of 1000 bits each. Calculate the total time for the data to be transmitted from A to B, assuming queueing and processing delays are negligible.
			</p>

			<p> <b>[Question 2]: </b>Two hosts are separated by a packet switch. The links in the connections are of bandwidth 10^7 bps and Propagation delay of 20 * 10^-6 seconds. The switch begins forwarding a
				packet only 35 * 10^-6 seconds after it receives the packet. If a file of size 10000 bits is split into packets of 5000 bits each, find the total transmission time.
