		<h2>Framing</h2>
		<p>For Ethernets, the frames are broadcasted to all receivers on the link. Only the intended recipient accepts the frame. However, there are some issues:
		<ol>
			<li>The SFD indicates when the frame begins, and the receivers check their own addresses with the one in the frame. Assuming that a frame has arrived at the intended receiver and it has begun reading, what happens if another frame arrives at the same receiver. </li>
			<ul>
				<li>Does it treat the second frame as a separate entity, or as a part of the current frame? </li>
				<li>We could ensure that all frames are of fixed size. Issue? Fragmentation </li>
			</ul>
			<li>Variable Size Framing could be implemented using a length field (used in Ethernets) or an end-frame delimiter (used in Token Ring) </li>
			<ul>
				<li>Character oriented methods</li> - What if the delimiter appears in the actual data?
				<li>Byte stuffing</li>
				<li>Bit stuffing: add a "complementary" bit for every first n-1 bit-sequence that matches with an n-bit delimiter.</li>
		</ol>
		<p>Example 1 : If the frame delimiter flag used by a transmitter is "0111", how is the data sequence "01110110" transmitted using bit-stuffing?
			<br>"0111" means match with "011" in data and add complementary bit "0" to separate the data from the flag. Transmitted data = 011 0 1011 0 0

		<h2>Switching</h2>
		<p>In the context of computer networks, switching is the process of forwarding a packet from one port to another. Routing, on the other hand is the process of preparing routing tables at each router. </p>
		<p>The two common methods of switching are (a) circuit switching, and (b) packet switching.
			Among them, circuit switching used to be prevalent in telephone communication (at exchange centers) at a time when the concept of computer networks and layering did not exist.
			Packet switching is performed at network layer, while circuit switching is not.
		</p>
		<p>
			The total time taken for a frame to reach from a sender to receiver =
			Setup Time + Transmission Time + (#hops)Propagation Delay + Tear-down time
		</p>
		<p>Properties of Circuit Switching:
			<ul>
				<li>Since the connection resources are reserved and fixed during communication, there is no need for a header</li>
				<li>The frames is guaranteed to arrive in the same order as they are sent i.e. there is no reordering</li>
			</ul>
		</p>

		<h3>Packet Switching</h3>
		<p>
			Packet switching uses store-and-forward technique during transmission since it is not guaranteed that the
			resources are reserved. When this happens, intermediate routers will "queue" the packet until it can be transmitted on the link.
			<br>
			Total time = (#hops)[Transmission delay + Propagation Delay] + (#hops - 1)[Queueing delay + Processing Delay]
			<br>
			<em>Question 1:</em> How is the total time for transmission for circuit switching different from packet switching?
			<br><br>
			<em>Question 2:</em> Which switching technique is preferred when the packet size is very large?
			<br><br>
			<em>Question 3: </em>How can the total time for transmission in packet switching be reduced?
			<br><br>
			<em>Question 4:</em> Consider a file of size 1000 bytes. Compare the transmission delays T1, T2, and T3 respectively of the store-and-forward packet switching approaches given below. Assume the header length of a packet to be 100 bytes, and the bandwidth to be same for all cases.
			(a)The entire file transmitted as such takes T1 time
			(b)The file split into 10 uniform packets takes T2 time
			(c)The file split into 20 uniform packets takes T3 time
