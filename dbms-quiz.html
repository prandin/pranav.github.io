    <p>This page will contain quiz questions that test understanding in the
    theoretical aspects of the course. I have ignored questions related to ER diagrams.</p>
    <h2>Key Constraints</h2>
    <ol>
      <li>[True/ False] "If X is a foreign key in R that references the primary key P of S,
        then deletion of a tuple in R will enforce a foreign key constraint check."</li>
    </ol>

    <h2>Normalization Techniques</h2>
    <ol>
      <li>If all the attributes of a relation R is prime, then find the maximum
      normalization form that holds for R?<b>[Hint: Use third point of Carlos' definition]</b></li>
      <li>[True/False] "Decomposition of a relation into BCNF may not be lossless" <b>[False; Repeated decomposition
        of a relation into BCNF is always lossless.]</b></li>
      <li>[True/ False] "Decompistion of a relation into BCNF may not be dependency preserving" <b>[True]</b></li>
      <li>[True/ False] "Some redundancy is possible in a 3NF relation" [True]</li>
      <li>[True/ False] "Decompositions into 3NF are always lossless and dependency preserving" [True]</li>
    </ol>

    <h2>Relational Algebra</h2>
    <ol>
      <li>What does the division operation do? What condition must be satisfied for division
      to be possible?</li>
      <li>What are the basic operations of relational algebra? Write them in the order of their
      precedence.</li>
      <li>[True/ False]: "Relational calculus is declarative"</li>
      <li></li>
    </ol>

    <h2>Indexing Structures</h2>
    <ol>
      <li>Given a data file with 100 records per page and 1000 pages and on index pagecapacity of 512 index entries,
        how deep should be the B+ tree to index this file.</li>
    </ol>
