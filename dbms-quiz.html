    <p>This page will contain quiz questions that test understanding in the
    theoretical aspects of the course. I have ignored questions related to ER diagrams.</p>
    <h2>Key Constraints</h2>
    <ol>
      <li>[True/ False] "If X is a foreign key in R that references the primary key P of S,
        then deletion of a tuple in R will enforce a foreign key constraint check."</li>
    </ol>

    <h2>Normalization Techniques</h2>
    <ol>
      <li>If all the attributes of a relation R is prime, then find the maximum
      normalization form that holds for R?<b>[Hint: Use third point of Carlos' definition]</b></li>
      <li>[True/False] "Decomposition of a relation into BCNF may not be lossless" <b>[False; Repeated decomposition
        of a relation into BCNF is always lossless.]</b></li>
      <li>[True/ False] "Decompostion of a relation into BCNF may not be dependency preserving" <b>[True]</b></li>
      <li>[True/ False] "Some redundancy is possible in a 3NF relation" <b>[True]</b></li>
      <li>[True/ False] "Decompositions into 3NF are always lossless and dependency preserving" <b>[True]</b></li>
      <li>[True/ False] "The natural join of two relations in BCNF is always BCNF" <b>[False; e.g. see decompostions into BCNF]</b></li>
    </ol>

    <h2>Relational Algebra</h2>
    <ol>
      <li>What does the division operation do? What condition must be satisfied for division
      to be possible?</li>
      <li>What are the basic operations of relational algebra? Write them in the order of their
      precedence.</li>
      <li>[True/ False]: "Relational calculus is declarative"</li>
      <li></li>
    </ol>

    <h2>Indexing Structures</h2>
    <ol>
      <li>Given a data file with 100 records per page and 1000 pages and on index page capacity of 512 index entries,
        how deep should be the B+ tree to index this file.</li>
      <li>Consider 5 blocks B1 ... B5 for a large file having fields (ID, Department, Name) where ID is the primary key.
        Each block Bi holds ID values 100*i to 100*i + 99. What are the first three primary index entries built for the data file?
        Also write where their corresponding block pointers point to. </li>
      <li>[True/ False] "A primary index is sparse"</li>
      <li>Consider an ordered file with 40000 records stored on a disk with block size 1024 B. File records
      are of fixed-length and are unspanned, with a record size of 100 B. Find:
      <ol>
        <li>The blocking factor for the data file</li>
        <li>The number of blocks required for the file</li>
        <li>Number of block accesses required to perform a binary search on the data file. </li>
      </ol>
      If the ordering key field for the file is 11 B long and a block pointer is 8 bytes long, and a primary
    index is created for the file, find:
      <ol>
        <li>The blocking factor for the index file</li>
        <li>The number of blocks required for the index file</li>
        <li>Number of block access required to perform a binary serch on the index file.</li>
      </ol></li>
      <li>What is the major issue with primary indexing?<b>[Insertions and deletions in a sorted file]</b></li>
      <li>Consider a Table T with a key field K. A B tree of order P, where P denotes the
        maximum number of record pointers in a B tree. Assume K is 10 bytes long,
        disk block size is 512 Bytes, record pointer is 8 bytes and block pointer size is 5 bytes long.
        Find the maximum value of P for each B tree node to fit in a single disk block .</li>
      <li></li>
