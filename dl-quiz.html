    <h2>Number Systems</h2>
    <p>Decimals; Binary; Octal; Hexadecimal; Self-Complementing Codes;</p>
    <ol>
      <li>Which of the following code systems are NOT self-complementary: (i)5211, (ii)641 -3, (iii)6111?</li>
      <li>What is the range of decimal numbers represented by an n-bit 1's complement number?</li>
    </ol>

    <h2>Combinational Circuit</h2>
    <p>Multiplexers;</p>
    <ol>
      <li>How many 2:1 MUX would be required to design a 32:1 MUX?</li>
      <li>How many 8x256 decoders are required to design a 4x16 decoder?</li>
      <li>A 1-bit full adder circuit takes 5 ns to generate the carry-out bit and 10 ns for the sum-bit.
         If three 1-bit full adders are cascaded, find
        the maximum rate of additions per second. <br><b>[Carry Time = (N-1)*carry ]</b>
        <br><b>[Sum Time = (N-1)carry + sum]</b></li>

    </ol>

    <h2>Counters</h2>
    <p>Delays in Counters;</p>
    <ol>
      <li>A 3-bit ripple counter uses JK flip flops. If the propagation delay of each flip flop is 50 ns,
      then find the maximum clock frequency (in MHz) that can be used. <b>[Hint: Combinational delay is zero]</b></li>
      <li>Find the minimum number of AND gates required for a 5-bit carry lookahead generator.<b>[Hint: n(n+1)/2]</b></li>
      <li>How many mod-13 and mod-6 counters are required to create a mod-78 counter?<b>[M = M1*M2*...*Mn]</b></li>
      <li>A 4-bit synchronous counter is made using flip flops of propagation delay 10 ns each. What is the
      maximum delay possible?<b>[T<sub>delay</sub> = T<sub>f</sub> + T<sub>combination</sub>]</b></li>
      <li>"Counters are used as frequency dividers". For a binary MOD-N counter, the clock frequency
      is 256 KHz. If the output frequency from the flip flop corresponding to the MSB is 2 KHz, find N.</li>
    </ol>
