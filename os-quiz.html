  <h2>Processes and Threads</h2>
  <ol>
    <li>Compare user-level threads and kernel-level threads on the following characteristics: (a) transparency with respect to kernel,
    (b) overhead, (c) efficiency and speed, (d) management.</li>

    <li>[True/ False] "There is a lack of coordination between user-level threads and the kernel"</li>

    <li>[True/ False] "User-level threads are faster to switch than kernel-level threads."</li>
  </ol>

  <h2>Process Management</h2>
  <ol>
    <li>A system has 10 resources of the same type. If each process of the system needs 4
    resources, find the maximum number of such processes that can be accomodated
    for the system to be deadlock-free.</li>

    <li>If each of 4 processes spend 1/4th of its total burst time for I/O operations, find the CPU utilization (in %), assuming
      that the I/O operations are overlapped.</li>

    <li>[True/ False] "A process must have at least one thread." <b>[True, though it depends on implementation]</b></li>

    <li>Which of the following are NOT shared between related threads: (a) Data (b) Stack (c) Code (d) Heap?</li>

    <li>[True/ False] "If a user-level thread gets blocked, all its peers are also blocked" <b>[True]</b></li>

    <li>How is a livelock different from a deadlock?</li>

    <li>Four processes P1, P2, P3, P4 all arrive at the same time. Their total execution times in time units are 20, 10, 10, and 20 respectively.
    The first 20% and last 20% of their total execution times are CPU bursts, while the remaining are IO bursts. The OS uses
    longest remaining time first algorithm (preemptive), with priority given to processes with the lowest process ID when multiple processes
    arrive at the ready queue with similar burst times. All I/O operations can be overlapped. Compute the average turaround time.</li>
  </ol>

  <h2>System Calls</h2>
  <ol>
    <li>[True/ False] "The virtual address of both parent process and child process will be same" <b>[True]</b></li>

    <li>[True/ False] "The physical addres of both parent process and child process will be same during a fork() call." <b>[False]</b></li>


  </ol>
  <h2>Virtual Memory</h2>
  <ol>
    <li>A process has 1024 page tables in memory. Its corresponding page table is also stored in memory. The
    overhead for reading a word from the page table is 5 ms. To reduce this overhead, the system has a
    TLB holding 32 entries and can perform a complete search in 1 ms. Find the minimum hit rate (in %)
    requird to reduce the mean overhead of accessing the page table to at most 2 ms.</li>

    <li>An instruction takes a time of 5 ms and a page fault takes an additional time of 2 ms.
      If on average a page fault occurs at every 100th instruction, find the effective instruction time.</li>

      <li>A computer system implemnts 8 KB pages and a  32-bit physical address space.
        Each page table entry contains a valid bit and the translation.
        If the maximum size of the page table of a process is 20 megabytes, then find the length
      of the virtual address supported by the system (in bits).
      </li>

      <li>Suppose a system uses SJF scheduling and it is estimated that the exponential average of the measured length of previous CPU burst is 0.25.
        If the initial value of the predicted CPU burst time is 4 units, find the predicted time (in units) for the 4th CPU burst for a
        process with burst times of 4 units, 12 units and 8 units respectively. </li>

        <li>Assume that we have a demand-paged memory. The page table is held in registers. It takes 8 milliseconds to service a page fault if an empty frame is
          available or if the replaced page is not modified and 20 milliseconds if the replaced page is modified.
          Memory-access time is 100 nanoseconds.  Assume that the page to be replaced is modified 70 percent of the time.
          What is the maximum acceptable page-fault rate for an effective access time of no more than 200 nanoseconds? <b>[Hint: Consider each case and their
            probability: to find a page in main memory, page faulted - space available/ un-modified frame + all modified frames]</b></li>


  </ol>

  <h2>Memory Management</h2>
  <ol>
    <li>Consider a disk of size 80 GB. The size of a disk block is 8 kB.
      Find the number of blocks required to keep track of free space using bit map method if the disk is initially empty.</li>

    <li>In a particular Unix OS, each data block is of 256 bits and each node has 4 direct datablock addresses and 3 additional addresses:
      One for single indirect block, one for double indirect block and one for triple indirect block.
      Each block is addressed with 64 bits. Find the total size of a file possible in the file system (in k-bits).</li>
  </ol>
