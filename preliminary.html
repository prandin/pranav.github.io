      AVL Trees; Hash Tables;
    </p>

    <p>
    <ol>
      <li>
        Consider a 2D-array A[3...15][4...10] arranged in column-major order.
        If the base address of A is 2000 and each element of A takes up 2 bytes,
        find the address of the element A[6][6].
      </li>

      <li>
        What kind of binary trees are AVL trees? <b>[Ans. BSTs]</b>
      </li>

      <li>
        What is the expected search cost for (a) successful search, and
        (b) unsuccessful search
        in open hashing, with a load factor of k?
      </li>

      <li>
        What is the expected search cost for
        (a) successful search, hand
        (b) unsuccessful search
        in linear probing, with a load factor of k?
      </li>

      <li>
        What is the expected number of probes in successful search
        of open addressing? What is the expected number of
        probes required to insert an element if the search
        is unsuccessful? Let load factor = k.
      </li>
